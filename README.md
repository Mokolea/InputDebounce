# InputDebounce Arduino Library

Simple polling input debounce Arduino library.

Facts:
 - used for push-button like switches
 - delivers input value (state) after it has been stable (not flickering) longer than the debounce period
 - delivers pressed-on time [ms]
 - assumes input pin with external pull-up resistor
